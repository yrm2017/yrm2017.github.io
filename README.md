YRM2017
========

**The ETSF Young researchers' Meeting (YRM)** is held annually under the
auspices of the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF). It brings
together young researchers (PhD students and postdocs) working in the field of
*ab initio* electronic structure calculations of real materials and gives them
an opportunity to present their work in front of an international audience.
All young researchers are invited to apply through the 
[ETSF YRM web-page](https://yrm2017.github.io/) and submit an abstract for a
poster or an oral contribution.

The YRM 2017 will be held at ICIQ, Tarragona, Spain on June 5-9, 2017.
