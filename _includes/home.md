The [ETSF Young Researchers' Meeting](about) (YRM) is an annual workshop for
non-permanent scientists, mainly postdocs and PhD students, who work on
state-of-the-art theoretical and computational methods for the study of the
electronic and optical properties of materials.
It addresses problems and recent advances in method development, algorithms
and implementations as well as applications to real materials.

Young researchers are given a chance to showcase their work, exchange ideas with
others at their own level, learn novel techniques, start new collaborations,
and improve their presentation skills.

The YRM 2017 will be held from June 5-9 at the [ICIQ](venue) in
Tarragona, Spain, and will host the following five [topical sessions](program):

 * **Structure prediction and phase transitions**
 * **Strongly correlated electrons and quantum magnetism**
 * **Electronic excitations**
 * **Vibrations and electron-phonon coupling**
 * **Quantum transport and electron dynamics**

Keynote talks at the beginning of each session give the participants an
overview of the field, introducing the theoretical framework, state-of-the-art
methods and open questions.

In addition to the scientific sessions, the meeting will include a session on
**the future of scientific publishing** with representatives from the newly
founded [SciPost](https://scipost.org/) and
[Quantum](http://quantum-journal.org/) non-profit journals as well as one day
dedicated to **talks by researchers from the private sector**, who will share
their experience of working in a non-academic setting.
