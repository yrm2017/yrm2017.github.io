## What is the ETSF YRM?

**The ETSF Young researchers' Meeting (YRM)** is a series of conferences held
annually under the auspices of the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility
(ETSF). It brings together young researchers (PhD students and postdocs)
working in the field of ab-initio electronic structure of real materials and
gives them an opportunity to present their work to an international audience.
All young researchers are invited to apply through this web-page and submit an
abstract for a poster or an oral contribution.

The talks are divided into thematic sessions. In order to make them accessible
even to students working on different areas, every session is opened by a
keynote speaker who will try to give a broad and didactic introduction to the theory
and the methods used to tackle the topic.
He/she also points to current challenges, thus providing pointers to successive
talks of the session.

In order to give young scientists opportunity to discover research in the
private sector, it is tradition to dedicate one day to presentations from
industrial researchers. This gives attendees a unique opportunity to compare
the research activity in the two domains, to structure their career and to
envisage outreach collaborations.

## What is the ETSF?

**The [European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility](http://www.etsf.eu) (ETSF)**
is a knowledge center for theoretical spectroscopy carrying out
state-of-the-art research on theoretical and computational methods for studying
electronic and optical properties of materials. This network comprises many
facilities and laboratories in Europe and the USA performing research in real
materials, encouraging the collaboration among research teams. Besides
theoretical development, it aims to strengthen the link to experimental groups
and industrial research.
